# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-
Handwritten digit recognition is in the forefront of optical character recognition for a long time. Starting from a postal mail sorting to bank cheque processing it has many applications. As unsupervised learning algorithms, we explore K-means clustering techniques along with principal components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data. For supervised learning, we begin with a linear classifier and then explore neural network, support vector machines and nearest neighbour based algorithms. For benchmarking the learning algorithms, we used a well-researched dataset named MNIST and compare the performances using prediction accuracy. In this work, we discuss theoretical details of the methods under consideration and whether any tuning parameters need to be chosen by the user for improved performance. Since this is a huge database, we also discuss some computation issues regarding the implementation of the algorithms.

# Introduction:
Handwritten Digit Recognition Hand writing recognition of characters has been around since the 1980s. The task of handwritten digit recognition, using a classifier, has great importance and use such as: online handwriting recognition on computer tablets, recognize zip codes on mail for postal mail sorting, processing bank check amounts, numeric entries in forms filled up by hand (for example ‐ tax forms) and so on. The handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer applications to recognize the human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes. The handwritten digit recognition system is a way to tackle this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image. Convolutional Neural Network model created using PyTorch library over the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. Handwritten Digit Recognition is the capability of a computer to fete the mortal handwritten integers from different sources like images, papers, ouch defenses, etc, and classify.  them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). This has been a  Content of bottomless- exploration in the field of deep literacy.  Number recognition has numerous operations like number plate recognition, postal correspondence sorting, bank check processing, etc. (2). In Handwritten number recognition, we face numerous challenges. Because of different styles of jotting of different peoples as it .is not an Optic character recognition. This exploration provides a comprehensive comparison between different machine literacy and deep literacy algorithms for the purpose of handwritten number recognition. For this, we've used Support. Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional.Neural Network. The comparison between these algorithms is carried out on the base of their delicacy, crimes, and. testing- training time corroborated by plots and maps that have been constructed using matplotlib for visualization.

# Objective:
•	to convert handwritten digits into machine readable formats.
•	use pattern matching to convert handwritten letters into corresponding computer text or commands in real time.
•	to visualize artificial neural network.
# Methodology:
Our proposed CNN is introduced to recognize four arithmetic operations. Figure is the general flow chart of implementing CNN in handwritten numeral recognition. To complete the automatic check of the mathematical assignment, it is necessary to draw a digit first, and then correct the skew images from the photos. Then, CNN is used to recognize the characters in the images, and finally, the recognized results are compared with the right answers.

# Datasets Details: 
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively. It is a widely used and deeply understood dataset and, for the most part, is “solved.” Top-performing models are deep learning convolutional neural networks that achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, with an error rate between 0.4 %and 0.2% on the hold out test dataset. Handwritten character recognition is an extensive exploration area that formerly contains detailed ways of perpetration which include major literacy datasets, popular algorithms, features scaling and point birth styles. MNIST DATASET(Modified National Institute of Norms and Technology database) is the subset of the NIST dataset which is a combination of two of NIST’s databases Special.  Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 and Special Database 3 correspond of integers written by high academy scholars and workers of the United States Census Bureau.  independently. MNIST contains a aggregate of handwritten. number images (- training set and- test set) in.  28x28 pixel bounding box andanti-aliased. All these images have corresponding Y values which apprises what the number
